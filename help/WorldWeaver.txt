Since you are viewing this, it is assumed you have Java installed and know
how to launch the %title%Admin.jar.

%title% consists of two components:

%title%Admin:
    The admin tool is used to compile %title% games. For more information
    on game development use:
    help game development

%title%Client:
    The client tool is used to play %title% games once they are compiled
    and installed. For information on installing compiled games use:
    help installing games
    help playing games


Developers:
The source code for both the client and the admin tools can be pulled from
Bit Bucket. In time it may be made publicly available. If you are interested in
