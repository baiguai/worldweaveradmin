Description:
    Room components define anything that the player can travel into. They are
    typically actual rooms, or areas within rooms, or even an object that is
    large enough for the player to enter. Rooms can also be locations on top
    of objects or under them. It is entirely up to the game author. For
    information on travelling use:

Syntax:
    Rooms are defined as a component, using curly braces {} to denote them.


Required Properties:

    The alias property is a unique identifier for the Room. This allows other
    components such as Actions or Logic blocks to reference it. The alias must

    The label is a friendly name for the Room. It is used as the title when
    the Room is being described to the player.
