When defining Commands or Events it is important to be aware of the order in
which the game processes the various elements. For example, if you want an Event
to output a Message THEN fire another Object_Event, you will want to put the
Message in an Event and in the Command call the Message Event then the second
Event you want fired. If you put the Message and the second Event in the same
Event the game will process the Actionsets in the Event first followed by the
Messag(s) in that Event - resulting in them being output in the wrong order.

In general elements are processed in this order:

Commands
Events
Actionsets
Messagesets

Elements are output in the order they are defined within the files. However
if the elements are defined in different files the order isn't predictable.
For example Connector Objects are output last to make it easier for the player
to read. If you need Objects to be output in a specific order, place them within
the same file. However Connector Objects will still be output last, but in the
order that they are defined amongst that Object type.
