01) Create the splash screen for your game. Navigate to the following directory:

<WorldWeaverAdmin>
|__ Games
    |__ MazeMaster


03) Create a file called splash.txt within the MazeMaster directory.
    You can use an ASCII text generator like the following to generate an ASCII
    title image (Or similar tools to convert an image to ASCII). This title
    image is denoted by <TITLE>.
    http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20
    Add the following to the splash.txt file:

   <TITLE>

   play
   resume

   Once playing:
   help

   exit


    This text gives the player some helpful notes on game play commands they can
    enter. The file is read exactly as entered (Be sure to use an editor that
    uses a mono-spaced font). So to move items down, put line breaks before them.
    To move items right, put spaces before them.

    The splash.txt file is required for any game we tell the Client to play by
    default - so when it is launched the splash is shown intead of an
    available games menu.
