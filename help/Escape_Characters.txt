Since characters such as commas or braces are used by %title% when parsing
through game definitions there are situations when these characters must be
treated differently. One such situation is when a comma is part of a property's
value. Consider the following:

{room, alias=redsphere, label=Sphere\, Red
    ...
}

To escape characters precede them with a back slash \.

If a brace { or [ is located at the beginning of a line of text, and it doesn't
specify the beginning of a component, it is good to escape it, just to be save.
The same holds true if the brace } or ] is located at the end of a line of text.

If you encounter strange behavior, characters that need escaped is a possible
reason.
