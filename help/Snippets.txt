Code snippets can be created to help speed up game development. Most of the
snippet commands begin with 'create', and all except the create room command
generate code that can be copied and pasted into existing source files.
Each create call will give you instructions on the parameters to enter.



create room
This command will create a new Room code file. It uses the active path value
to determine which folder the file is created in. You can use the following
commands to set the active path:

pwd
Displays the current active path.

ls
Lists the files and directories in the active path (If the path is valid).

cd /<path>
Replaces the active path with the path you specify:
cd /Games/SomeGame
Will set the active path to: Games/SomeGame/

cd <path>
Changes to the specified path, appending it to the current path. If the current
path is: /Games/SomeGame/ and you call:
cd Locations
The active path becomes: /Games/SomeGame/Locations/

cd ..
Moves up a folder. If the current active path is /Games/SomeGame/Locations and
you call cd .. the active path becomes:
/Games/SomeGame/
