Macros are game developer tools designed to make repetative tasks easier. One
example is compiling a game that is currently being developed. If the game in
question is called Dungeon Explorer, a macro could be defined by creating the
file:

<%title%Admin>
  |__ Data
      |__ Macros
          |__ de (Short names are good, they are used to call the macro)


In this file, the following can be added:

nbuild DungeonExplorer,Dungeon_Explorer


Then to build this game:

macro de


Macro files can contain any %title%Admin commands, exactly as they would
be entered manually, and in the order they should be entered.

NOTE:
As part of a macro, you can copy compiled game files to other locations using
the copyfile command:

copyfile Data/Games/NetSplit, ../../%title%Client/Release/Data/Games/NetSplit


NOTE:
To list the available macros use:
