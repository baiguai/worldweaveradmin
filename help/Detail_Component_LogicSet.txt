Description:
    LogicSets group together Logic blocks. Logic blocks must be defined within
    a LogicSet.
    If you need more than one LogicSet to be evaluated, define them within
    different parents. For example in an Event called 'take', if you need
    multiple LogicSets define one in 'take' and if that passes call another
    Event (E.G.: take2) and in that Event do the other LogiSet check.
    If the LogicSet fails, the element it is within is not processed.
    In addition to stopping the processing of its parent, a LogicSet can display
    a fail message, or call an Event within its parent Room, Object, Npc (The
    'self' parent of the LogicSet). For more information on the power of fail
    events, an the troubles they overcome use:

    help fail event


Syntax:
    LogicSets are defined as a game component using curly braces {} to denote
    them. For information on Logic blocks use:

    help logic component
