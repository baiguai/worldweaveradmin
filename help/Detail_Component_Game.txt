Description:
    Game elements define the game itself, setting some of the properties of the
    game.

    NOTE:
    There are special Attributes that can be defined within the Game component.
    For information on these, refer to the Special Attribute Values topic:

    help special attribute values


    NOTE:
    You will need to define a Player element within the Game element. This lets
    you configure players when they first begin playing the game.

    NOTE:
    If you would like to begin your game with an initial message, put an event
    of type game_init in your Game element.


Syntax:
    The game is defined as a component, using curly braces {} to denote it.
    It must be defined in the game.nrmn file in the game's root directory.


Required Properties:
    name:
    The friendly name for the game. This is used when listing the installed
    games that can be played.

    initial_location:
    When players begin the game for the first time, this is the alias of the
    Room they will begin in.

    stats_aliases:
    A pipe | delimited list of the Player attribute aliases to be used when the
    player calls the stats Command. For more information use:

    help stats


Optional Properties:
    admin_password:
    If this is set, the game can be put into admin mode by entering the admin
    password. When the game is in admin mode, the administrative tools can be
    accessed. Be sure to use a password that will not interfere with other
    Command syntaxes. It is a good idea to remove this property before publishing
    a game. For more information use:
