Sometimes Norman code may need to contain special characters that aren't
intended as code characters (Such as {'s or ['s). These characters need to be
'escaped' in certain circumstances. The need for escaping has been kept to a
minimum. Below are outlined instances where escaping is necessary.


INLINE PROPERTIES
    Inline properties utilize commas (,) to indicate where a property is being
    defined. So if a property value contains a comma it will need to be escaped:

    {object, name=sword type=Sword\, long }

    If the last character in a property is a closing curly bracket AND the
    element is NOT defined on a single line, it will need to be escaped:

    {room name=dungeon_entrance label=Dungeon {entrance\}
        ...
    }

    Equal signs (=) do not need to be escaped:

    {object, type=comparison item1=location item2=player comparison== }

    If the first character in a text object is { you will need to escape it:

    {messageset
        [message
\{player} ...
        ]
    }


TEXT ELEMENTS
    If a line of text within a text element contains only a square bracket (For
    some reason), it will need to be escaped:

    [sign
The sign reads:
[
Dungeon
\]
    ]
