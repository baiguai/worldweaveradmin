Description:
    Events define something that happens in response to a fired Action or
    Command. An Event can fire an Action or display a Message. With the
    exceptions of Room descriptions (When entering a Room) and Game Events
    firing an Event type cascades down to any child elements that have that
    Event type.

    NOTE:
    To define global Events that fire no matter where the Player is, place
    those Events in the Game object.

    NOTE:
    You can define multiple Events of the same type to utilize different
    Logic checks in each Event.


Syntax:
    Events are defined as a component, using curly braces {} to denote them.


Required Properties:
    type (One word):
    Specifies the type of Event to fire. There are pre-defined Events that

    or any custom type the game author chooses. Custom Events can be called
    using Actions and referencing the type value. For more information on
