Events can be called by Actions, using the event and object_event types. For
information on available Action types use:

help action types


Built in Events are fired automatically in certain scenarios. For examine the
enter / init Event type is fired whenever the player enters a Room. Actions,
Logic, Messages can be defined whthin an Event of this or other pre-defined
types and those will be processed. For example, to display a message when the
player enters a Room, you could do something like:

{evt, type=enter
    {mset
        [msg
            You are now standing in the spacious dungeon entrance.
        ]
    }
}

For more a list of the pre-defined Event types use:

help event types


NOTE:
In most cases %title% relies on the game author to define Commands and
Events etc. Very little is done automatically. For example, new Rooms do not
have built in 'look' Commands so the author must define these:

{room, alias=dungeon_entrance, label=Entrance
    {evt, type=look
        {mset
            [msg
                You look around.
            ]
        }
    }

    {cmd, syntax=l|look
        {aset
            {act, type=event, newvalue=look }
        }
    }
}
