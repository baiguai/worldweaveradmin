Both the %title% Admin and %title% Client tools come with some helpful
scripts (Geared primarily toward developers). These can be executed in a bash
shell using: sh <script file name> or in a Window command window
using: <.bat script file name>
Some of the scripts available are:

Admin:

_build
    Rebuilds the %title% Admin tool.

_client
    Launches the %title% Client that is packaged with the admin tool.

_cp_game
    Copies specified games to specified locations. You will need to adjust this
    according to your file structure. It is designed to install games to a
    client outside of the admin tool's directories.

_db
    Launches sqlite3 to the specified game db. This will need to be adjusted
    to open the game db you need.

_macro
    Launches the %title% Admin tool with the -m parameter to run a macro.
    The one parameter passed into the script is the macro's name. If you have
    a macro called 'dungeon' you would run its macro using:
    _macro.sh dungeon
    _macro.bat dungeon

_rmhelp
    Clears out the help system so the next time the Admin tool is ran the help
    system is rebuilt.

_run
    Launches the %title% Admin tool.

_yed
    Launches the Yed diagram application. See yWork's website:

Client:

    Demonstrates launching a game with its own branding - In this case Escape
    Apsis is launched.

_build
    Rebuilds the %title% Client tool.

_cp_client
    When developing the client tool, this will copy the compiled tool into the
    %title% Admin tool's packaged client directory. You will need to adjust
    this according to your file structure.

_db
    Launches sqlite3 to the specified game db. This will need to be adjusted
    to open the game db you need.

_run
    Launches the %title% Client tool.
