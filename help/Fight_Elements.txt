If your game utilizes fighting the Player and Npc elements must contain certain
Attributes. These Attributes are:

life:
    The player, and any Npcs the Player will be fighting must have an Attribute
    with an alias of life. The value of this Attribute can be a fixed number,
    however it is more interesting if it is a randomly generated value.

max_life:
    Max life is used to cap the Player's life. This is useful when defining
    Objects that restore the Player's life. If a max_life is set, the Player's
    life value will never exceed the max_life value. It is a good idea to set
    this to the initial life value:

    {player
        {attr, alias=life, type=random, value=10\,20 }
        {attr, alias=max_life, type=attribute, value={player}:life }
        ...
    }

initiative:
    Initiative determines who attacks first. If the Player has no set initiative
    the Fight engine uses a default value of 80 out of 100.
    This Attribute can also be defined in the Npcs the Player will need to
    fight. If no Npc initiative is set the Fight engine uses a default of 20 out
    of 100.

fight_label:
    This Attribute is used by Events such as attack. It can be referenced like:
    enemy:fight_label

fight_proper_label:
    This Attribute is used by Events such as attack. It should be used when it
    is the start of a sentence. It can be referenced like:
    enemy:fight_proper_label

fight_kill:
    This Attribute applies to Npcs and provides the verbage used when you kill
    it. This allows for wording like: 'You have destroyed the golem.' or 'You
    have killed the knight.' It can be referenced like:
    enemy:fight_kill

As the player advances in the game, this value can be adjusted using an Action
element.
