--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

follow
    Causes the npc to follow the player. This can be stopped by setting the
    TravelSet's active Attribute to false.

path
    Causes the TravelSet to go from the first Travel node location to the last,
    then the NPC works backward through its path.

random
    A set of Travels must be defined for the random mode, like the path and 
    repeat modes, however the NPC randomly chooses a direction along the path
    with each move.

repeat
    Causes the TravelSet to go from the first Travel node location to the last,
    then it works backward to the first one and starts over.
