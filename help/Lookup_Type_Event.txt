For the most part Event types are user defined. Events are called according
to their types, and game authors can define as many types as they wish. However
there are some pre-defined Event types that are fired by the game engine at
certain times throughout game play.

game_init:
    The game_init Event is only fired when the game first begins.

enter/init:
    This Event type is called whenever a Room is entered.

tick:
    Events with a type of tick are fired every time the Player enters a
    valid Command. They allow the Game to change state or display messages
    regardless of the Actions fired etc. It gives the Game a timer of sorts.
    These Events can be at any level, either Game-wide or per room, or even
    at the Object level etc. However they cascade down from the Game level,
    looking for tick Events.

exit:
    This Event type is called whenever the current Room is exited.

look:
    Although it is up to the author to define look Commands, this type of Event
    is called on a Room's Objects when the room is entered.
