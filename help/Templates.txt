The term Template refers to any standard game component that is designed to
be a 'template', or something that may be different each time the game is played
for the first time, or when the component is cloned or spawned. Defining a
template entails utilizing special Attribute values/types such as random or
Attributes that point to the value of another Attribute. The Player component
is a good example of this. It is often the case that each time a game is played
for the first time the player has slightly different stats etc.
