Description:
    Logic blocks perform logical checks according to the specified type
    property. For a list of available Logic types use:
    help logic types

    Logic blocks must be defined within a LogicSet. LogicSets group Logic
    blocks. For more information on LogicSets use:
    help logicset component

    There are two ways to define the logical evaluation:

    - inline:
        This method is useful for single line Logic blocks. It uses the Logic
        element's properties to specify what to check.

    - eval:
        An eval multi-line object can be used to define logical evaluations.
        This is the preferred method. It allows multiple checks to be defined
        within a single Logic Block.
        NOTE: Be sure to use the @ symbol so that the eval will be processed
        line by line.

    The comparison operand is specified either inline in an eval component or using
    the operand property. For information on operands use:
    help operands

    NOTE:
    Special values can be used in the source or sourcevalue. For more information
    use:
    help special values


Syntax:
    Logic blocks are defined as a component, using curly braces {} to denote them.


Required Properties:
    type:
    Specifies the type of logical evaluation to perform. Other properties are
    needed according to the specified type. For more information on Logic types
    use:
    help logic types


Optional Properties:
    source
    sourcevalue
    operand

    These properties are required, or not needed at all, according to the Logic
    type. Use:
    help logic types


Allowed Parent Components:
    logicset


Allowed Child Components:
    eval (message)
    messageset
