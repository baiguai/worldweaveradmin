There are many tools in %title% that game authors can use to aid in the
development of games. Such tools include:

Scripts:
    %title% comes packages with shell and .bat scripts to aid developers
    and game developers. For more information use:

    help scripts


Macros:
    Macros make %title% Admin commands less tedious. Multiple commands or
    lengthy commands can be entered by calling a macro. For more information
    use:

    help macros


Admin Tools:
    While playing a game, testing it, the game can be put into admin mode
    by specifying an admin password. Entering that during game play toggles
    the admin mode. When in this mode admin commands can be entered. For more
    information use:

    help debugging


Tests:
    Tests are essentially macros that can be run while playing a game, in admin
    mode. For more information use:
