FILES
    Norman Notation files are standard text files that use the extension .nrmn
    For example: game.nrmn


ELEMENTS
    Norman Notation is very simple. There are only two types of elements that
    can be defined. Standard Elements and Text Elements.

    Standard elements can contain any number of properties and other elements.

    Text elements only contain text, this can be multiple lines of text.

    For more information on Elements use:
    help norman elements


PROPERTIES
    Standard elements can contain any number of properties, these can be defined
    in the first line of the element code, or on their own lines throughout
    the element.

    For more information on Properties use:
    help norman properties


COMMENTS
    Comments are notes that authors can leave for themselves or others who
    might work on the code in the future. They have no effect on the defined
    elements or properties.

    For more information on Comments use:
    help norman comments


ESCAPING
    Sometimes text within properties or text elements run the risk of being
    interpreted as the beginning or end of elements or properties. To avoid this
    the characters can be 'escaped'.
    
    For more information on this use:
    help norman escape
