Interactive Fiction (IntFiction, IF) is a type of game that is text-based.
They are read like books, but commands can be entered to move through the game
or interact with it. There are numerous IF engines that have been created
to allow games to be developed and played using either an authoring graphical
tool, or by writing game definition files (code files), then compiling the games
for use in a client tool. This is how %title% works. Other engines may work
slightly different. Some are more code-like than others - which strive to make
game building more like authoring books.

For information on IF in general, refer to:

It may also be helpful to read through some of the topic in:

https://intfiction.org/forum/

That forum is dedicated primarily to TADS or Inform (two such IF engines)
development.


%title% differs primarily in two ways.

Portability:
    Other IF engines can be difficult or impossible to play on various systems.
    TADS games, for example, can be played via a web browser, but the web parser
    is more limited than the desktop OS version. Because %title% is Java
    based, it can be played on any platform that is Java-capable.

Flexibility:
    %title% requires more work on the game author's end, but because of this
    it is more flexible. Game authors aren't stuck using set commands such as
    compass directions to define travelling, or specific commands for actions
    such as eating, drinking etc. Such commands can be extended but this
    requires some complex code to define custom commands etc. In %title%
    the author can define whatever commands they want, for whatever action
    they need. It is easy to define any syntax the author defines. Also it is
    easier to define games using any file structure the author desires without
    the need to tell the engine which files to include. With %title%, any
    file within the game directory is parsed. Files can be moved or renamed,
    combined, or split up without any refactoring.
