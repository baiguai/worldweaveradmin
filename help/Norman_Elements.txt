--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elements in Norman Notation are defined using either curly brackets:
{ ... }
or square brackets:
[ ... ]

Curly brackets define standard elements and square brackets define text elements.
For examples use:
help norman examples



STANDARD ELEMENTS
    Standard elements are defined by curly brackets. They can contain other
    elements (standard and text), and they can also contain any number of
    properties. For more information on properties use:
    help norman properties

    Elements can be defined on a single line, or in multiple lines:

    {attribute name=damage value=-5 }

    {attribute
        name=damage
        value=-5
    }

    If an element is on a single line be sure to put a space before the closing
    bracket.


TEXT ELEMENTS
    Text elements are elements that contain only the name of the element and
    text content. Text lines are wrapped at 80 characters, or the overridden
    width as specified in the game. To insert additional line breaks wherever
    you add a break to the text add an at (@) symbol right after the open bracket
    ([):

    [sword_desc
The sword is gleaming silver.
It is a double- handed\nsword.
    ]

    Would output:
The sword is gleaming silver. It is a double- handed
sword.


    [@sword_desc
The sword is gleaming silver.
It is a double- handed
sword.
It is bloody
    ]

    Would output:
The sword is gleaming silver.
It is a double- handed
sword.
It is bloody.

    Notice the \n in the text content. That is a line break character.
    For more information use:
    help norman special characters

    NOTE:
    Text elements can be defined on a single line - for short text strings.
    To do so, separate the element name from the content using two double
    quotes (==)

    [sword_desc==You see a long sword]

    Would output:
You see a long sword
