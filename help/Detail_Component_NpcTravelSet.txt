Description:
    TravelSets define an NPC's travel. If the mode property is not set to
    follow the TravelSet must contain one or more Travel components that
    tell the NPC where to travel during a given step in its travel.

    A special Attribute can be used with the TravelSet. This Attribute must
    have an alias of active and can have a true or false value. If this is
    present and set to false, the TravelSet is ignored. This Attribute can
    be changed using an Action.


Syntax:
    NPC travelset  components are defined as a component, using curly braces {}
    to denote them.


Required Properties:
    mode:
    The mode property tells the TravelSet how to choose the next Travel
    component when it is called. TravelSets are called whenever the player
    travels to a new location. For information on the possible travel modes
