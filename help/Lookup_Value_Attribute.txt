Attribute values can be more than simply a specified value. This allows
Attributes to inherit their values from other Attributes etc. Possible special
Attribute values are:

display_mode:
    Display mode is a special Attribute that must be defined within the Game
    component. This tells the game engine to either clear the console before
    displaying its output, or to simply add the output below the existing
    console contents. The alias must be set to display_mode and the value can
    be:
    - clear
        Clears the console before the game's output is displayed.

    - normal
        Appends the game's output to whatever is currently displayed.

wrap_width:
    Another special Attribute of the Game component is wrap_width. It tells the
    game engine how wide (in characters) the output can be. The alias must be
    set to wrap_width and the value can be any positive numeric value. (80 or
    120 is typical)

random:
    Attributes with a type property of random must have a value that defines
    the range of the random number to choose, in the form of:

    <min>\,<max>

    Once this value is randomly chosen, that is the value returned every time
    the Attribute's value is read.

attribute:
    Attributes with a type property of attribute derive their value from another
    Attribute's value. The value property must specify this Attribute in the
    form:

    <parent alias>:<attribute alias>

random (each read):
    An Attribute can have a value that is randomly generated every time its
    value is read. To do this, its value must be set using the following syntax:

    {random}|<min>\,<max>
