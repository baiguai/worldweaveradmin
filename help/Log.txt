Description:
    Log elements are messages that are useful during the development of a
    game. To view logs put the game in admin mode and enter:

    _log <type>

    For more information on admin mode use:

    help debugging

    The actual log text is defined within a child multi-line text element
    using square braces [] to denote it.

    NOTE:
    One helpful use of logs is to keep track of testing results. Whenever
    a Room is tested, notes can be added to that room using a Log element
    in its file.


Syntax:
    Log entries are defined as components, using curly braces {} to denote
    them. Logs can be defined anywhere within the game definition files.
    It is a good idea to define them outside of other game components, just
    to be safe.


Required Properties:
    type:
    Defines the log's type. This property allows the logs to be grouped.


Allowed Child Components:
    text
