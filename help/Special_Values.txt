In various components such as Logic blocks, Actions, or Attributes special
values can be used to denote game elements without specifying their actual
aliases. Possible special values include:

{armed}
    Specifies the player's currently armed weapon (If the game uses weapons).

{input}
    Replaces {input} with the user's input. This can be used when generic
    input is expected such as numbers etc. I can only be used for the newvalue
    of Actions or Message text within a Command element.
    (See NetSplit's Apartments Elevator)

{player}
    Specifies the current Player.

{room}
    Specifies the Room the Player is currently in.

{self}
    Specifies the Game, Npc, Player, Object, or Room the current element is
    a child of.
