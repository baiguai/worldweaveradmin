Description:
    Sort Elements can be added to a parent Element (Any Element that has one or
    more Elements within it - Rooms, Objects with other Objects in them, etc).
    They allow the game author to define the description order in one place.
    Sorting can be changed without opening multiple definition files and tweaking
    sort properties.

    Note:
    Sort Elements override any sort properties set in the aliases listed in the
    Sort Element.


Syntax:
    Sort blocks are defined as a component, using curly braces {} to denote them.


Required Children:
    object or obj:
    Defines the Objects or NPCs to be sorted and the order in which they should
    be sorted.


Allowed Parent Components:
    npc
    object
    room


Allowed Child Components:
    object (message)
    npc (message)
