Various game components are defined within groups that help to accomplish their
specific functions. For example Logic blocks are grouped into LogicSets so that
more than one condition can be checked - and the failure actions for that
LogicSet can be associated with it. This groupig is always required.

There are other components that have optional grouping. A single component does
not need to be defined within a group. For example Messages or Actions can
be defined on their own. If there is only one Message or only one Action there
is no need to do the extra typing of adding them to a group - although this
can be done if you like for consistency.

Grouped components that can be defined as stand-alone are:


- Messages (message or msg)
- Actions (action or act)


All the other grouped components must always be within a parent grouping.
