For the most part a game's structure is up to you. Each game must have its own
directory within <%title%Admin>/Games/

Required Files:
There is one file that must be defined in a specific place and given a specific
file name. This is the game file:

<%title%Admin>
  |__ Games
      |__ <Your Game>
          |__ game.nrmn


This file houses the definition of the game itself. It lets %title% know
what location new players start in, as well as properties of the game. For more
information use:
help game component


All other game files can be defined anywhere within the game's directory, or
subdirectories within the game's directory. For information on game definition
files use:
help definition files
