MessageSets can contain any number of Message components. Which Message the
MessageSet chooses to display is governed by the repeat property. Possible
repeat types are:

none:
    The MessageSet begins with the first Message and moves down the list each
    time it is fired. Once it reaches the bottom, that one is chosen from then
    on. This is the default repeat mode.

random:
    The MessageSet chooses a Message randomly.

repeat:
    The MessageSet begins with the first Message and moves down the list each
    time it is fired. Once it reaches the bottom, the next time it is fired it
    starts at the first one again.
