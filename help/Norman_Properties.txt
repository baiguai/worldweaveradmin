Standard elements can contain properties that define the elements. These
properties are key, pairs.


INLINE PROPERTIES
    Properties can be defined on the same line, as long as they appear in the first
    line of the element:

    {room, name=dungeon_entrance, label=Dungeon Entrance
        ...
    }

    They must be separated by commas (Including a comma after the element's name.


OTHER PROPERTIES
    Properties can also be defined on their own lines in the document:

    {room
        name=dungeon_entrance
        label=Dungeon Entrance

        ...
    }

    There are less considerations when not defining properties inline,
    however inline properties keeps the code lines down and makes the files
    more readable. For more on inline property considerations use:
