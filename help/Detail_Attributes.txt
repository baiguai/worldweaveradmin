About:
    Attributes are used to extend game components. They can be used in
    conjunction with logic checks or messages. They allow  the game developer
    to define the functionality they need for their games.

Syntax:
    Attributes are defined like a component, using curly braces {} to denote
    them. They are usually defined on one line, but can be written with each
    property on its own line, beginning with {attribute on its own line and
    ending with the closing brace on its own line.

Required Properties:
    alias (one word):
    Aliases must be unique within the Attribute's parent. They are the
    Attribute's unique identifier.

    value:
    Defines the Attribute's default value. This value can be changed by Action
    components. Values can be numbers or text or special codes. For information
    on these codes use:
    help special attribute values

Optional Properties:
    type (one word):
    Defines Attributes as special types of Attributes. For a list of possible
    types use:
    help attribute types
