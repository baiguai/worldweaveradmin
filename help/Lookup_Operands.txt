Operands tell the Logic Block how to compare the specified source against the
specified sourcevalue. When comparing strings (text), the only operands available
are = and !=. All other operands pertain to numeric comparisons.
Below are the possible operands:

% (modulo - the remainder after division)
    For information on this operation, see:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
    Example:
    [@eval
        attribute@{self}:level%5=0
    ]
    In this example if the division of the level Attribute value has no remainder
    the Logic Block evaluates to true.

> (greater than)
    If the source value is greater than the specified value the Logic Block
    evaluates to true.

< (less than)
    If the source value is less than the specified value the Logic Block
    evaluates to true.

>= (greater than or equal to)
    If the source value is greater than or equal to the specified value the
    Logic Block evaluates to true.

<= (less than or equal to)
    If the source value is less than or equal to the specified value the
    Logic Block evaluates to true.

= (equals)
    If the source value equals the specified value the Logic Block evaluates to
    true.

!= (not equal to)
    If the source value does not equal the specified value the Logic Block
    evaluates to true.
