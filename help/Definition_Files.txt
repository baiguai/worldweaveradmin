%title% games are defined in human readable plain text files. The
organization and division of these files is entirely up to the game author.
Entire game levels could be defined in single files, or each Object could have
its own file. Directory structure is also entirely up to the game author - with
a couple of caveats:

- Each game must be defined within a single root directory.

- A game.nrmn file must exist in the root directory, and define the game itself.


For example, a game could be stored in files organized like below:

<%title%>
  |__ Games
      |__ DungeonExplorer
          |__ game.nrmn
          |__ Level01
              |__ Entrance
                  |__ Entrance.nrmn
                  |__ Messages.nrmn
                  |__ Objects.nrmn
                  |__ Doors.nrmn

Or the same game could be structured:

<%title%>
  |__ Games
      |__ DungeonExplorer
          |__ game.nrmn
          |__ Entrance.nrmn (The entire Room defined in a single file)

Because of this flexibility, %title% is capable of handling very large
games.
