{player
    ...
}


Description:
    The Player component specifies how new players are defined when they
    play the game for the first time. Player components are typically
    defined as template components so that the player is different every
    time. For more information on templates use:

    help player example
    help templates

    Note:
    You will want to utilize some of the built-in Action types when defining
    the Player component - such as inventory, stats, etc.
    For information on Action types use:
    help action types

    Note:
    If the Player is defined with an Attribute with an alias of:
    name
    That value will be used in every new game. Otherwise the player will be
    prompted to provide a name when a new game is begun.


Syntax:
    The Player element is defined as a component, using curly braces {} to
    denote it.
