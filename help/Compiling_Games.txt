build Dungeon_Explorer, DungeonExplorer


Description:
Before %title% games can be played they must be compiled. This will parse
the definition files and generate a game database. The resulting database is
automatically imported into the %title%Admin Client tool. This is a copy
of the %title%Client tool used to run and test games. A script has been
included to launch this client. See:

help scripts


Syntax:
build <output file name>, <game directory>


Required Parameters:
    output file:
    Specifies the file name for the resulting game database. This value must be
    an allowable file name. Since %title% is cross platform, be sure the
    file name is allowed in the operating systems you want it playable in.

    game directory:
    Specifies the directory within the Games folder. This is the directory that
    contains the game definition files. See:

    help game development
