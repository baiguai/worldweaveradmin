Games can also be played by launching the %title% client tool using the
game's database file name as a parameter. This method allows the game's author
to brand the game as desired. When the client is launched this way, the game's
splash screen is displayed instead of the default %title% splash screen.
If no splash is defined, the game's name and initial commands are displayed.

To define a splash screen enter the text and or ASCII art into the following
file:

<Game Root Directory>
  |__ splash.txt

The contents of this file are displayed exactly as the text is entered in the
file.


When building the splash screen, the possible commands the player can enter
on that screen are:
play
resume

It is good to build a splash screen that lets the player know these are the
commands available to them.



To cause the %title% client to automatically launch a game, displaying its
branding, add an init_game setting to the:

<Client Root Directory>
  |__ Config
        |__ Global.config

For example, if your compiled game file (See: help compiling games) is
TheDungeon you would add:

init_game=TheDungeon

to the Global.config file.

Note:
Any game specified in the init_game setting MUST have a splash file:

<Game Root Directory>
  |__ splash.txt
