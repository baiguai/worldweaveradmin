%title% has various administrative tools built into it to aid in the
debugging of games:

Logging:
    Logging allows the game developer to create notes that are useful during
    debugging. Log messages are defined within the game definition files. For
    more information use:

    help log


Admin Mode:
    If the Game element has a specified admin_password value, while playing the
    game entering this password will toggle the admin mode. While in admin mode
    the administrative debugging tools are available. To view the possible
    admin tools enter the command:

    _admin

    within the game (while in admin mode). These tools allow the tester to
    jump to locations in the game, kill enemies with a command, analyze
    Attributes and Rooms, even die.

Tests:
    Tests can be defined in the game definition files. Tests can be run while
    the game is in admin mode. Tests are essentially macros that make repetative
    tasks easier. For more information use:

    help tests
